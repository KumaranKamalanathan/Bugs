1405B - MSIE11 MSHTML CView::CalculateImageImmunity use-after-free
=====================================

Synopsis
--------
Specially crafted HTML can cause a use-after-free vulnerability in MSIE 11.

Known affected versions
-----------------------
  + MSIE 11

Attack vectors
--------------
  * MSIE
    
    An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
    webpage.

Mitigations
-----------
  * MSIE
    
    As far as can be determined, disabling JavaScript should prevent an
    attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Repro
-----

    <script>
      var oDocumentFragment = document.createDocumentFragment(),
          oElement = document.createElement('x');
      oDocumentFragment.appendChild(oElement);
      oElement.style.listStyleImage = "url(x)";
      oDocumentFragment.removeChild(oElement);
    </script>

Description
-----------
Setting the "listStyleImage" property of the oElement causes MSIE 11 to
allocate 0x4C bytes for an "image context" structure, which contains a
reference to the cDoc object as well as a reference to the same CMarkup
object as the oDocumentFragment (amongst other things).
Because the element is remove from the document fragment, this context is
freed on the next "draw". However, the code continues to use the freed context
almost immediately after it is freed.

Exploit
-------
I tried a few tricks to see if there was an easy way to reallocate the freed
memory before the reuse, but was unable to find anything. I do not know if
there is a way to cause further reuse of the freed memory later on in the code.
Running the repro as-is without page heap does not appear to trigger crashes.
