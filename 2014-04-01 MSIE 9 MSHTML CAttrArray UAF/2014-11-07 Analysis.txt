1404A - MSIE 9 MSHTML ParseListStyleProperty UAF
=====================================

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted webpage can cause Microsoft Internet Explorer to reallocate
a memory buffer in order to grow it in size. The original buffer will be copied
to newly allocated memory and then freed. The code continues to use the freed
copy of the buffer.

Known affected versions
-----------------------
  + MSIE 9

Attack vectors
--------------
  * MSIE
    
    An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
    webpage.

Mitigations
-----------
  * MSIE
    
    Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from triggering the
    vulnerable code path.

Repro
-----
<!doctype html>
<script>
  oTextArea = document.createElement('textarea');
  oTextArea.dataSrc = 1;
  oTextArea.id = 1;
  oTextArea.innerHTML = 1;
  oTextArea.onvolumechange = 1;
  oTextArea.style.setProperty('list-style', "url()");
</script>

Description
-----------
The CAttrArray object initially allocates a CImplAry buffer of 0x40 bytes,
which can store 4 attributes. When the buffer is full, it is grown to 0x60
bytes. A new buffer is allocated at a different location in memory and the
contents of the original buffer is copied there. The repro causes the code to
do this, but the code continues to access the original buffer after it has been
freed.

Notes
-----
I allow vendors 60 days to fix an issue, unless they can provide an adequate
reason for extending this deadline. Failure to meet a deadline without an
adequate explanation will normally result in public disclosure of information
regarding the vulnerability to the general public.
